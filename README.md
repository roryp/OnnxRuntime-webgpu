### Overview of ONNX Runtime

**ONNX Runtime (ORT)** is a cross-platform, high-performance machine learning model accelerator. It provides a flexible interface to integrate hardware-specific libraries, making it compatible with models from various frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, TFLite, and scikit-learn. ORT is designed to improve inference performance for a wide variety of machine learning models and can run on different hardware and operating systems. It's widely used in Microsoft products and services, such as Office, Azure, and Bing.

### Overview of WebGPU

**WebGPU** is a web graphics API that allows web applications to efficiently use the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) of a device for graphics rendering and computation. It is the successor to WebGL and provides better compatibility with modern GPUs, support for general-purpose GPU computations, and access to more advanced GPU features. WebGPU is designed with the web platform in mind, featuring an idiomatic JavaScript API, integration with promises, and support for importing videos. It aims to provide more powerful, faster, and safer graphics performance than WebGL.
